                  exhibit brightness variations in such a way that a
                  standard Fuzzy C-Means (fcm) segmentation algorithm
                  fails. As a consequence, modified versions of the
                  algorithm can be found in literature, which take
                  into account the artifact. In this work we show that
                  the application of a suitable pre-processing
                  algorithm, already presented by the authors,
                  followed by a standard fcm segmentation achieves
                  good results also. The experimental results ones are
                  compared with those obtained using SPM5, which can
                  be considered the state of the art algorithm
                  oriented to brain segmentation and bias removal.},

                  techniques have been proposed. These segmentation
                  techniques can be categorized into three classes,
                  (1) characteristic feature thresholding or
                  clustering, (2) edge detection, and (3) region
                  extraction. This survey summarizes some of these
                  techniques. In the area of biomedical image
                  segmentation, most proposed techniques fall into the
                  categories of characteristic feature thresholding or
                  clustering and edge detection.}

                  background has many important applications, such as
                  human computer interaction, video compression,
                  multimedia content editing and manipulation. Most
                  existing methods work on image pixels or color
                  segments which are computationally expensive. Some
                  methods require extensive manual inputs, static
                  cameras, and/or rigid scenes. In this paper we
                  propose a fully automatic foreground segmentation
                  method based on sequential clustering of sparse
                  image features. The sparseness makes the method
                  computationally efficient. We use both edge and
                  corner points extracted from each video frame. A
                  joint spatio-temporal linear regression method is
                  developed to compute sparse motion layers of M
                  consecutive frames jointly under the temporal
                  consistency constraint. Once the sparse motion
                  layers have been identified for each frame, the
                  corresponding dense motion layers are created using
                  the Markov Random Field (MRF) model. The MRF model
                  assigns the rest of the image pixels to the motion
                  layers by considering both the color attributes and
                  the spatial relations between each pixel and its
                  surrounding edge/corner points. Experimental
                  evaluations on videos taken by webcams show the
                  effectiveness of the proposed method.},

                  segmentation method for determination of the volume
                  of cerebrospinal fluid, gray matter, and white
                  matter in living human brain, and to determine the
                  method's reliability.  METHODS: We developed a
                  computer method that allows rapid, user-friendly
                  determination of cerebrospinal fluid, gray matter,
                  and white matter volumes in a reliable manner, both
                  globally and regionally. This method was applied to
                  a large control population (N = 57).  RESULTS:
                  Initially, image brightness had a strong correlation
                  with the gray-white ratio (r = .78). Bright images
                  tended to overestimate, dim images to underestimate
                  gray matter volumes. This artifact was corrected for
                  by offsetting each image to an approximately equal
                  brightness. After brightness correction, gray-white
                  ratio was correlated with age (r = -.35). The
                  age-dependent gray-white ratio was similar to that
                  for the same age range in a prior neuropathology
                  report. Interrater reliability was high (.93
                  intraclass correlation coefficient).  CONCLUSIONS:
                  The method described here for gray matter, white
                  matter, and cerebrospinal fluid volume calculation
                  is reliable and valid. A correction method for an
                  artifact related to image brightness was developed.},

  abstract =	 {We propose a motion segmentation algorithm that aims
                  to break a scene into its most prominent moving
                  groups. A weighted graph is constructed on the image
                  sequence by connecting pixels that are in the
                  spatiotemporal neighborhood of each other. At each
                  pixel, we define motion profile vectors which
                  capture the probability distribution of the image
                  velocity. The distance between motion profiles is
                  used to assign a weight on the graph edges. Using
                  normalised cuts we find the most salient partitions
                  of the spatiotemporal graph formed by the image
                  sequence. For segmenting long image sequences, we
                  have developed a recursive update procedure that
                  incorporates knowledge of segmentation in previous
                  frames for efficiently finding the group
                  correspondence in the new frame},

    abstract = {{We propose a motion segmentation algorithm that aims to break a scene into its most prominent moving groups. A weighted graph is constructed on the image sequence by connecting pixels that are in the spatiotemporal neighborhood of each other. At each pixel, we define motion profile vectors which capture the probability distribution of the image velocity. The distance between motion profiles is used to assign a weight on the graph edges. Using normalised cuts we find the most salient partitions of the spatiotemporal graph formed by the image sequence. For segmenting long image sequences, we have developed a recursive update procedure that incorporates knowledge of segmentation in previous frames for efficiently finding the group correspondence in the new frame}},
