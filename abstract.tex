Segmenting materials images is a laborious and time-consuming process
and automatic image segmentation algorithms usually contain
imperfections and errors.  Interactive segmentation is a growing topic
in the areas of image processing and computer vision, which seeks to
find a balance between fully automatic methods and fully-manual
segmentation processes. By allowing minimal and simplistic interaction
from the user in an otherwise automatic algorithm, interactive
segmentation is able to simultaneously reduce the time taken to
segment an image while achieving better segmentation results. Given
the specialized structure of materials images and level of
segmentation quality required, we show an interactive segmentation
framework for materials images that has two key contributions: 1) a
multi-labeling framework that can handle a large number of structures
while still quickly and conveniently allowing manual interaction in
real-time, and 2) a parameter estimation approach that prevents the
user from having to manually specify parameters, increasing the
simplicity of the interaction.  We show a full formulation of each of
these contributions and example results from their application.
